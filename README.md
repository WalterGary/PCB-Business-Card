# PCB-Business-Card
This Is a repo for a PCB business card designed using Kicad

2025-10-17 1st hour:
I made a new kicad project and make the dimentions of the business card. I also imported the logos that will be on the PCB by creating new footprints and modifying them.

2025-10-17 2nd hour:
I learned how to alter the layer that graphic footprints are on. I also added a ruler using a kicad plugin that places footprints geometrically. I plan to add more business information and and potentially an NFC coil. I will need to reaserch how to cheaply add nfc chips for inexpensive cards.
